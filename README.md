#Twitch Board

Page showing a list of Twitch streamers. Online and streaming users are placed on top of the list and highlighted in green. The list can be filtered via buttons and show All, Online or Offline users only.

To build this app I've used Boostrap and jQuery, and for collecting data Twitch's API.
